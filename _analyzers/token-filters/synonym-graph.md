# Synonym graph token filter

The `synonym_graph` token filter is more advanced version of `synonym` token filter, as it allows for multi-word synonyms handling. It can handle synonyms across multiple tokens, making it suitable for phrases or when the relationship between tokens matters.

## Parameters

The `synonym_graph` token filter can be configured with the following parameters.

Parameter | Required/Optional | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- 
`synonyms` | Either `synonyms` or `synonyms_path` needs to be configured | String | List of synonym rules defined directly in the configuration.
`synonyms_path` | Either `synonyms` or `synonyms_path` needs to be configured | String | File path to synonym rules, absolute or relative to config directory.
`lenient` | Optional | Boolean | Ignore the exceptions when loading the rule configurations. Default is `false`.
`format` | Optional | String | Specifies which format is used to determine how synonyms are defined and interpreted by OpenSearch. Options are: `solr` or [`wordnet`](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/). Default is `solr`.
`expand` | Optional | Boolean |  Expand equivalent synonym rules. Default is `false`.<br><br>For example: <br>If `expand` is set to `true` with synonym defined as `"quick, fast"`, the synonym rules are configured as follows:<br>- quick => quick<br>- quick => fast<br>- fast => quick<br>- fast => fast<br><br>If `expand` is set to `false`, the synonym rules are configured as follows:<br>- quick => quick<br>- fast => quick

## Example using solr format

The following example request creates a new index named `my-index` and configures an analyzer with `synonym_graph` filter with default `solr` rules format:

```json
PUT /my-index
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "my_synonym_graph_filter": {
          "type": "synonym_graph",
          "synonyms": [
            "sports car, race car",
            "fast car, speedy vehicle",
            "luxury car, premium vehicle",
            "electric car, EV"
          ]
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "my_synonym_graph_analyzer": {
          "type": "custom",
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
            "my_synonym_graph_filter"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Generated tokens

Use the following request to examine the tokens generated using the analyzer:

```json
GET /my-car-index/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_synonym_graph_analyzer",
  "text": "I just bought a sports car and it is a fast car."
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the generated tokens:

```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {"token": "i","start_offset": 0,"end_offset": 1,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 0},
    {"token": "just","start_offset": 2,"end_offset": 6,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 1},
    {"token": "bought","start_offset": 7,"end_offset": 13,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 2},
    {"token": "a","start_offset": 14,"end_offset": 15,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 3},
    {"token": "race","start_offset": 16,"end_offset": 26,"type": "SYNONYM","position": 4},
    {"token": "sports","start_offset": 16,"end_offset": 22,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 4,"positionLength": 2},
    {"token": "car","start_offset": 16,"end_offset": 26,"type": "SYNONYM","position": 5,"positionLength": 2},
    {"token": "car","start_offset": 23,"end_offset": 26,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 6},
    {"token": "and","start_offset": 27,"end_offset": 30,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 7},
    {"token": "it","start_offset": 31,"end_offset": 33,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 8},
    {"token": "is","start_offset": 34,"end_offset": 36,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 9},
    {"token": "a","start_offset": 37,"end_offset": 38,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 10},
    {"token": "speedy","start_offset": 39,"end_offset": 47,"type": "SYNONYM","position": 11},
    {"token": "fast","start_offset": 39,"end_offset": 43,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 11,"positionLength": 2},
    {"token": "vehicle","start_offset": 39,"end_offset": 47,"type": "SYNONYM","position": 12,"positionLength": 2},
    {"token": "car","start_offset": 44,"end_offset": 47,"type": "<ALPHANUM>","position": 13}
  ]
}
```

## Example using WordNet format

The following example request creates a new index named `my-wordnet-index` and configures an analyzer with `synonym_graph` filter with [`wordnet`](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) rules format:

```json
PUT /my-wordnet-index
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "my_synonym_graph_filter": {
          "type": "synonym_graph",
          "format": "wordnet",
          "synonyms": [
            "s(100000001, 1, 'sports car', n, 1, 0).",
            "s(100000001, 2, 'race car', n, 1, 0).",
            "s(100000001, 3, 'fast car', n, 1, 0).",
            "s(100000001, 4, 'speedy vehicle', n, 1, 0)."
          ]
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "my_synonym_graph_analyzer": {
          "type": "custom",
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
